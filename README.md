# Benefits-of-a-coworking-environment

This repository contains my some of the benefits I discovered after using Pluria, STUP and Bucharest Hub coworking spaces, with some disadvantages outlined too.

# Advantages
- no time spent on commuting
- no money spent on commuting
- no need to spend money out or to pack food at home
- easier to focus on work and avoid any distractions 

# Disadvantages
- daily commuting time
- preparing yourself for the daily departure and arrival
- risks of getting a disease, not necessarily covid or smth, but even something as basic as a cold
- being distracted by other people or the environment
